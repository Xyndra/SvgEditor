Contributions are generally happily receaved, as long as they don't add any fishy libraries or change the style

What should be kept in:
- Lightweightnes - The goal is to merge everything into a single file at the end, so there should not be any huge file dependencies
- Controllability - Libraries shall be kept at a minimum, and they should be somewhat well knows
- Simplicicity - This should not end up like photoshop where you need to watch a 5 minute tutorial for everything you try to do
- Client side only - This should not have to be maintained anywhere, it should just be able to be opened
- Good look - just make the ui look good, no one wants half-finished ui
